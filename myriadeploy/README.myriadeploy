TO USE:

1) in myria source, run gradle jar and copy myriad-0.1.jar here

2) if the destination machines need it, copy JRE 7 here.
   if not, fix the setup_cluster script to not care.

3) copy workers.txt.sample to workers.txt and modify it for your needs

4) don't forget to remove any existing catalog directories or the system might
   throw an exception.
