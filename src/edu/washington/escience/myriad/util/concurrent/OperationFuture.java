/**
 * This class serves as the root of all the handle objects for asynchronous operations.
 * <p>
 * An asynchronous operation is an operation which is issued by one thread and then gets executed/served by, typically,
 * another execution entity. The execution entity here can be a thread. For example in {@link ExecutorService}, a
 * {@link Callable} or a {@link Runnable} is submitted by a client thread to an executor pool, in which a thread will
 * execute the code some time later. The execution entity can also be a group of threads, a group of processes, or even
 * a group of computers. For example in a parallel computing system, a job is submitted by a client and gets executed on
 * all the machines governed by the computing system.
 * 
 * <h3>State machine</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link OperationFuture} maintains a state machine. The state machine has two different groups of states:
 * <em>uncompleted</em> or <em>completed (or done)</em>. The completed state group includes three predefined states:
 * <em>succeed</em>, <em>cancelled</em>, and <em>failed</em>. Implementation classes may add more completed states if
 * necessary. Once an {@link OperationFuture} enters into a completed state, the state will never get changed.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When an operation begins, a new {@link OperationFuture} object is created. The new future is uncompleted initially -
 * it is neither succeeded, failed, nor cancelled because the operation is not finished yet. If the operation is
 * finished either successfully, with failure, or by cancellation, the future is marked as completed with more specific
 * information, such as the cause of the failure. Please note that even failure and cancellation belong to the completed
 * state.
 * 
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                                      +---------------------------+
 *                                      | Completed successfully    |
 *                                      +---------------------------+

 * +--------------------------+    |    |   isSuccess() = <b>true</b>      |
 * |        Uncompleted       |    |    +===========================+
 * +--------------------------+    |    | Completed with failure    |

 * |    getCause() = null     |    |    +===========================+
 * +--------------------------+    |    | Completed by cancellation |
 *                                 |    +---------------------------+
 *                                 +---->      isDone() = <b>true</b>      |
 *                                      | isCancelled() = <b>true</b>      |
 *                                      +---------------------------+
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 
 * Various methods are provided to let you check if the operation has been completed, wait for the completion, and
 * retrieve the result of the async operation. It also allows you to add {@link OperationFutureListener}s so you can get
 * notified when the state of the operation is changed.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * There are two predefined types of listeners: <b>Completed State Listeners</b> and <b>Progress Listeners</b>. The
 * completed state listeners will be notified after the future enters any of the completed state. These listeners will
 * only be executed once. The progress listeners may get notified zero or more times. The semantic of the progress
 * listeners are defined by operation future implementations.
 * 
 * <h3>Thread model</h3>
 * 
 * The operation task submission thread is typically different from the operation execution thread. But they can be the
 * same.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The state of the future object may get modified by one or more threads (for non-completed states). If a thread is
 * trying to modified an already-in-completed-state future, it must fail.
 * 
 * If a thread moves the state of the operation into a completed one, all completed state listeners must be notified
 * once and only once. The order is not defined. The thread executing them should be either the one caused the completed
 * state change or a dedicated listener notifier thread.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The complete state of the future won't get lost. If a listener is added after the future reached a completed state,
 * the listener should be executed immediately either by the thread adding the listener or by the dedicated listener
 * notifier thread.
