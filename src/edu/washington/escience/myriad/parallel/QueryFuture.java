/**
 * The result of an asynchronous {@link QueryPartition} operation.
 * <p>
 * All query operations in Myria are asynchronous. It means any query related operations will return immediately with no
 * guarantee that the requested operation has been completed at the end of the call. Instead, you will be returned with
 * a {@link QueryFuture} instance which gives you the information about the result or status of the query operation.
 * <p>
 * A {@link QueryFuture} is either <em>uncompleted</em> or <em>completed</em>. When an query operation begins, a new
 * future object is created. The new future is uncompleted initially - it is neither succeeded, failed, nor cancelled
 * because the query operation is not finished yet. If the query operation is finished either successfully, with
 * failure, or by cancellation, the future is marked as completed with more specific information, such as the cause of
 * the failure. Please note that even failure and cancellation belong to the completed state.
 * 
 * <pre>

 *                                      | Completed successfully    |
 *                                      +---------------------------+

 * 
 * Various methods are provided to let you check if the query operation has been completed, wait for the completion, and
 * retrieve the result of the query operation. It also allows you to add {@link QueryFutureListener}s so you can get
 * notified when the query operation is completed.
 * 
 * <h3>Prefer {@link #addListener(QueryFutureListener)} to {@link #await()}</h3>
 * 
 * It is recommended to prefer {@link #addListener(QueryFutureListener)} to {@link #await()} wherever possible to get
 * notified when an query operation is done and to do any follow-up tasks.
 * <p>
 * {@link #addListener(QueryFutureListener)} is non-blocking. It simply adds the specified {@link QueryFutureListener}
 * to the {@link QueryFuture}, and query thread will notify the listeners when the query operation associated with the
 * future is done. {@link QueryFutureListener} yields the best performance and resource utilization because it does not
 * block at all, but it could be tricky to implement a sequential logic if you are not used to event-driven programming.
 * <p>
 * By contrast, {@link #await()} is a blocking operation. Once called, the caller thread blocks until the operation is
 * done. It is easier to implement a sequential logic with {@link #await()}, but the caller thread blocks unnecessarily
 * until the query operation is done and there's relatively expensive cost of inter-thread notification. Moreover,
 * there's a chance of dead lock in a particular circumstance, which is described below.
 * <p>
 * In spite of the disadvantages mentioned above, there are certainly the cases where it is more convenient to call
 * {@link #await()}. In such a case, please make sure you do not call {@link #await()} in an query thread. Otherwise,
 * {@link IllegalStateException} will be raised to prevent a dead lock.
